# Deabetic Assistant App

This application was an exercise for me to learn and pracctice React skills. 

The app aims at helping people with diabetes control their condition, but 

### IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR REAL USAGE. 

The app has 3 functionalities: 

1) Injection/ Pump rotation
2) Bolus Calculator
3) Food checker (checking carbs in foods)

#### This App uses the EDAMAM API 

### To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser
